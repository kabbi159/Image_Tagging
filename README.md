# **Image_Tagging**
### **Implementations of Fast-Tag and Fast-Zero-Tag**
<br />

## **Code sources**
* We procured the codes for Deep Learning for Fast-Zero Tag from http://crcv.ucf.edu/projects/fastzeroshot/ and Fast Tag from www.cse.wustl.edu/~mchen/code/FastTag/fasttag.tar.gz.
* We implemented Rank-SVM for Fast-Tag ourselves.
* We also modified the above code for learning the kernelized mapping from image vector to principal
  direction in ranking SVM’s.
* We implemented the neural network(Figure 3) for fasttag in caffe[5].
* DATASET: IAPRTC-12
